They seem to spring forth from the earth, water, or whatever surface the spell is cast upon. The tentacles attempt to grasp and crush any creatures within their reach.Every creature within the spell's area must make a ~grapple check~[TAG_GRAPPLE], opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles. The tentacles are treated as a large creature with 19 ~strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], and with a base attack bonus equal to the spell's caster level. Thus, the tentacles' grapple check is 1d20 + 8 + caster level.Each round on your turn, the tentacles attempt further grapple checks against creatures within their reach. A successful check initiates a grapple with the tentacles, or if the creature is already grappling, deals 1d6+4 bludgeoning damage.The tentacles immediately attempt to grapple any creature entering the area of effect. Even creatures that are not currently grappling with tentacles can only move at half speed within the area of effect.The tentacles are immune to all forms of damage.Note: when attacking grappling opponents from range, the target is determined randomly. So, there is a 50% chance that ranged attacks will instead hit the tentacles, to no effect.

The weapon gains a +1 ~enhancement~[TAG_ENHANCEMENT_BONUS] bonus and it deals damage as if it were two size categories larger. For typical medium weapons, this means that they will deal 2d6 damage rather than 1d6.These effects only occur when the weapon is wielded by the caster. For other creatures, the weapon behaves as if unaffected by this spell.
